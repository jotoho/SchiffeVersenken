# Schiffe Versenken

This is a work-in-progress software project which has the goal of implementing the game Battleships (in german: "Schiffe versenken")
for usage on the command-line. The project is written in C++17.

## Usage

N/A (coming soon)

## Compilation

We intend to provide a Makefile for compilation at some point.
But for now, we run test files from `tests/` via the following
command:

```sh
./run.sh <source file>
```
